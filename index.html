            is a historic and spiritually significant site located in Addis Alem,
            Oromia Region, Ethiopia. Known for its rich history and architectural
            beauty, the church stands as a testament to Ethiopia's deep-rooted
            Orthodox Christian traditions.The church was established during the
            reign of Emperor Menelik II, who envisioned Addis Alem as a potential
            new capital for Ethiopia. Although the plan to relocate the capital was
            abandoned, the emperor transformed the area into spiritual hub by
            constructing this magnificent church. The church is dedicated to the
            <strong>Virgin Mary</strong> and holds a special place in Ethiopian
            Orthodox Christianity.

                The area around the church includes residences and buildings that
                were originally part of Menelik II's planned palace complex. Some of
                these structures were built in the early 1900s and reflect a blend
                of traditional Ethiopian and Europian architectural styles. These
                houses often feature wooden balconies, stone foundations, and wide
                verandas, offering a nostalgic view of Ethiopia's transitional era
                from empire time.

                The school trains debteras in liturgy, hymnography (Zema), biblical
                studies, and church rituals. It ensures the continuity of Ethiopian
                Orthodox chant (Mezmur), poetry (Qene), and Ge'ez (ancient
                liturgical language). Some students may advance to become priests or
                monks after years of study.
